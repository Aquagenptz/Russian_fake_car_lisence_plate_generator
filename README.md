# Russian_fake_car_lisence_plate_generator
_________
Hello everybody!!! I present to you a small convenient tool for generating random images of automobile registration plates of the Russian standard. This tool can be used to test or train license plate recognition systems. The algorithm also simulates various optical effects, such as blurring and imitation of dirt on the number.
__________
##### To generate a dataset, run the script and specify the required number of images (parameter "--num"):
#### python ./rus_random_plate.py --num 10
